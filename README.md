Customer Purchase Prediction using Decision Tree
 Overview

This project applies a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral attributes. The model is trained on the Bank Marketing Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository


The dataset includes customer information such as age, job, marital status, education, financial details, and marketing interactions. The goal is to identify which customers are most likely to subscribe to a term deposit, helping businesses improve marketing strategies and decision-making.

‚öôÔ∏è Methodology

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and preparing the dataset.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding customer demographics, behaviors, and campaign patterns.

Model Development: Implemented a Decision Tree Classifier using scikit-learn.

Evaluation: Assessed the model using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix, and ROC-AUC.

üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Libraries

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn

üöÄ Results

Built a Decision Tree model capable of predicting customer purchase decisions.

Found that previous campaign outcomes, age, and contact type play a key role in influencing purchase decisions.

Achieved good predictive performance, making the model interpretable and useful for real-world marketing applications.
